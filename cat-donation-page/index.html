                    <h2>Making your home cat friendly</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Your cat's happiness is greatly influenced by how you behave and what kind of lifestyle you offer - as the cat is a territorial species. The environment is everything! First of all, therefore, you need to get the cat-related equipment and facilities right? particularly if you keep your cat exclusively indoors or give it restricted access outside. Even if you haven't made the decisions to have a house bound cat.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Anyone who's familiar with the behaviour of the cat will know that the saying 'a cat is not a small dog' is indeed very true - the same is true for health - eou can't just take the diagnoses and treatments applicable to dogs and scale them down to a cat.</p>
                    <p>The cat has its own unique psychology, diseases and reactions to drugs and treatments. Cats also have their own set of behaviours that can make even noticing illness very difficult. Cats never make things sraightforward...</p>

                <hr>
                <p>You have decided you want your life with a kitten and be responsible for it all through cat-hood. Your commitment could last for the next 14 to 15 years or even longer. This is a serious undertaking and you want to get it as right as you can.</p>
