                    <hr>
                    <p>Your cat's happiness is greatly influenced by how you behave and what kind of lifestyle you offer - as the cat is a territorial species. The environment is everything! First of all, therefore, you need to get the cat-related equipment and facilities right? particularly if you keep your cat exclusively indoors or give it restricted access outside. Even if you haven't made the decisions to have a house bound cat.</p>

                    <p class="white-text">The cat has its own unique psychology, diseases and reactions to drugs and treatments. Cats also have their own set of behaviours that can make even noticing illness very difficult. Cats never make things sraightforward...</p>
