            <h2>Fic Yeongyu</h2>
            <h1>Under the sky in room 553 I discovered you and I</h1>
            <p>“Have you ever heard about the origami hearts tradition in the hospital?”</p>
            <p>Taking the heart, the child excitedly inspected it, nodding in glee. “Yes! My mama told me that when someone leaves the hospital to go to heaven, we all fold a paper heart for them! Like this, like this!”</p>
            <p>“That’s right,” chuckled Soobin. “But do you know how it started? It started here, in this room. From a boy who used to fold a paper heart every day for his lost love, hoping each one he makes will take him closer to the day those eyes would open again.”</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately for him, the day never came."</p>
            <p>In other words, a hopeless love story of two childhood best friends who didn't realise what it meant to have each other until it was too late; compiled of yearning, loss, forlorn hope, unrequited love, and every tragedy in between.</p>

        <h2>Paper <i>Hearts</i>:</h2>
        <p class="lyrics">Goodbye love, you flew right by love. Pictures I'm living through for now, trying to remember all the good times. Our life was cutting through so loud, memories are playing in my dull mind. I hate this part, paper hearts, and I'll hold a piece of yours. Don't think I would just forget about it. Hoping that you won't forget. Everything is gray under these skies. Wet mascara. Hiding every cloud under a smile, when there's cameras. And I just can't reach out to tell you, that I always wonder what you're up to.</p>
